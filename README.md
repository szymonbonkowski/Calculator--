# Calculator-- 📉
### The world's most judgmental, passive-aggressive calculator.

**Calculator--** is a state-of-the-art mathematical engine designed for those who feel their computer uptime is too high. It features an advanced "Artificial Incompetence" backend that judges your input, refuses to give a straight answer, and ultimately forces you to touch grass by shutting down your PC.

## 🚀 Features

-   **High-Latency Processing:** Artificial delays to simulate "thinking" (or just judging your life choices).
-   **Schrödinger's Results:** Why get the correct answer when you can get *either* half of it *or* double it?
-   **The "Cutie" Protocol:** A proprietary termination sequence that ends with a compliment before killing your session.
-   **Forced Digital Detox:** Automatically executes a hard system shutdown after calculation.

## 📦 Downloads & Versions

Check the [Releases](https://github.com/TwojNick/Calculator--/releases) page for the latest binaries.

| Version | File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GUI Edition** | `Calculator--_GUI_Release_v1.0.0.exe` | **(Windows Only)** The premium graphical experience. Features buttons, text boxes, and a visual countdown to your doom. |
| **CLI Edition** | `Calculator--_CLI_Release_v1.0.0.exe` | **(Windows & Linux)** The hardcore command-line interface. Works natively on Windows and via Wine/Proton on Linux. For purists who like to see their terminal perish. |

*(Note: The GUI version uses the Win32 API and is not natively compatible with Linux, though the CLI version works perfectly fine for shutting down Linux machines via systemctl poweroff).*

## 🛠️ How It Works

1.  **Input:** You provide two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
2.  **Judgment:** The system analyzes your request. It will display status messages such as *"Judging your choices..."* and *"Consulting the Gods..."*.
3.  **The Result:** The calculator intentionally performs the wrong math, rounding the result to the nearest integer just to annoy you further.
4.  **The Climax:** It displays the message **"Brace for impact cutie <3"**.
5.  **The End:** Your computer shuts down immediately.
